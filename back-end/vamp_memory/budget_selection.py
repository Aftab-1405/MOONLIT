"""Token-budget selection for VAMP retrieval result units.

The retrieval pipeline produces a flat list of *units* (memory bullets
collected from one or more summary blocks). This module deduplicates them by
``unit_id``, sorts by retrieval score, and selects as many as fit within the
configured token budget (``VAMP_CONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS``) before re-sorting the
selection by ``(idx, bullet_index)`` for stable chronological display.

# too tight for 100+ block conversations — the most relevant bullets could be
# outside the top-10 by Qdrant similarity. Now: min(25, max(10, total // 3)).
# The budget selector (dedupe_select_budget_then_sort) then filters these
# down to what fits in vamp_token_budget, so a larger k doesn't cost tokens —
# it just gives the selector more candidates to choose from.

    1. Dedupe by ``unit_id`` (or ``summary_id`` fallback), keeping the
       highest-scoring copy when the same unit appears multiple times (e.g.
       once as a pinned latest-block bullet and once as a vector hit).
    2. Sort candidates by retrieval score (desc), rank, then text length
       (asc) so smaller, higher-rank units are preferred when scores tie.
    3. Greedily add candidates while ``used + size <= budget``.
    4. FIX [L12]: Guarantee at least the single highest-priority block even
       when every candidate exceeds the budget — previously a single
       oversized bullet (e.g. a 2500-token ``overview`` against
       ``VAMP_CONTEXT_MIN_TOKENS=2048``) wiped out ALL historical context
       for the turn.
    5. Re-sort the selection by ``(idx, bullet_index)`` for stable
       chronological display in the system prompt.

    Returns the selected units as a list of dicts (the same dict objects the
    caller passed in, possibly mutated by reference — but never modified here).
