LangGraph agent — streams agentic conversation over SSE.

Stream lifecycle (one SSE request == one agent turn)
-----------------------------------------------------
1. **Lease acquisition.** A ``TaskRunLease`` (Firestore document with a
   180s TTL, renewed every 60s by ``_renew_loop``) is acquired before any
   model call. The lease prevents two concurrent streams from mutating the
   same conversation's Redis checkpointer state. Acquisition is skipped for
   mock models used in unit tests.
2. **Checkpoint clearing (new-turn path).** For a brand-new user message
   (no resume), the Redis checkpointer thread is wiped via
   :func:`clear_checkpointer_thread` so the agent starts from a clean
   state rather than resuming a half-finished tool call from the previous
   turn. Paused/resumable tasks preserve their checkpoint.
3. **Context budget & VAMP retrieval.** :func:`prepare_stream_budget`
   measures system prompt, tool schemas, VAMP historical context, and any
   task checkpoint summary, then subtracts them from the model's context
   window to derive ``hot_history_budget`` (the token budget reserved for
   recent Firestore history).
4. **History seeding.** :func:`_load_firestore_history` walks recent
   conversation turns from newest→oldest, accumulating tokens until the
   budget is hit, and reconstructs LangChain ``HumanMessage`` /
   ``AIMessage`` objects.
5. **Streaming + compaction.** :func:`_stream_graph_with_continuations`
   runs ``agent.astream`` with a per-segment recursion limit. When the
   graph hits ``GraphRecursionError`` mid-flight, compaction runs and the
   stream resumes via ``Command(goto=...)``.
6. **Final compaction & lease release (finally block).** After the stream
   ends — normally, via error, or via client disconnect (``CancelledError``)
   — the ``finally`` block releases the lease FIRST (shielded, catches
   ``BaseException``), then performs best-effort checkpoint compaction.
   Reversing this order used to leak the lease on client disconnect
   (see FIX [C1] below).

Checkpoint compaction workflow
-----------------------------
:func:`check_and_perform_compaction` summarizes dropped messages into a
LLM-generated ``task_checkpoint_summary``, persists it to Firestore via
the task-state store, removes the original messages from the Redis
checkpointer via ``RemoveMessage``, and stores the new summary in
``config["configurable"]`` for injection on the next model invocation.
The :func:`_limit_checkpoint_summary` helper caps the summary length to
``MAX_TASK_CHECKPOINT_CHARS`` while preserving a head (recent goals) and
tail (recent state) slice so the model retains task continuity across
resume boundaries.

Builds a ReAct graph via :func:`graph.build_react_agent`, then streams with
``version='v2'`` unified stream parts (messages + custom tool events).
