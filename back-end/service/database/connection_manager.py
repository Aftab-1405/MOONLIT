"""
Multi-User Connection Manager

Manages database connection pools for multiple users with different configurations.
Each unique database configuration gets its own connection pool.
Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle through the adapter pattern.

Pool lifecycle and locking (FIX [M16])
-------------------------------------
Previously a single ``_global_lock`` was held during ``_create_pool``, which
makes a real network connect (``minconn`` synchronous TCP connects) and can
block every other user's ``get_connection`` for the full ``connect_timeout``
window when the DB is unreachable. We now create the pool *outside* the lock
and only install it into ``_pools`` under the lock (re-checking that no
other thread created one in the meantime).

The cleanup thread used to close pools whose ``_pool_last_used`` was older
than the idle timeout, with no check for in-flight borrows — a connection
still in use by a long-running query would have its pool closed underneath
it. We now track in-flight borrows per pool (``_pool_in_use``) and skip
cleanup for any pool with outstanding borrows.

Finally, the ``_pool_locks`` dict was created and deleted but never
acquired anywhere (dead code). It has been removed in favor of the
per-pool in-flight counter; per-pool serialization (when needed) is now
provided by the adapter's own pool implementation (``oracledb``,
``psycopg2.ThreadedConnectionPool``, mysql-connector's pooling are all
already thread-safe).
