Connection Handlers

Database connection handlers that return dicts (not framework responses).
All methods accept db_config explicitly.

Only remote-accessible databases are supported — connections to loopback
addresses (localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1) are rejected since the cloud-hosted
backend cannot reach a user's locally-running DBMS.

SSRF protection
---------------
Every connect path resolves the user-supplied host via ``socket.getaddrinfo``
and rejects any address that is private, loopback, or link-local (see
``_validate_host``). For connection-string-based remote connections
(``connect_remote_*``), the host is extracted from the *adapter's* parse
result rather than the handler's own regex, so that alternate formats the
adapter accepts (e.g. an Oracle string without a service name) cannot bypass
the check.

Connection lifecycle
--------------------
Validation must use ``manager.get_connection_context`` (a context manager
that always returns the connection to the pool on exit). Calling
``manager.get_connection`` directly for validation leaks the connection —
the pool fills up after ~5 attempts and every subsequent connect hangs.
``DatabaseOperations.get_databases`` and ``manager.get_cursor`` each acquire
their *own* short-lived connection and return it correctly, so the validation
connection is the only one we need to manage here.

    Validate that *host* does not resolve to a private/loopback/link-local IP.

    endpoint (e.g. ``169.254.169.254``), not the user's machine.

        of the form ``{"status": "error", "message": ...}``.

    Fail-closed policy
    ------------------
    Previously, DNS resolution errors were swallowed with a bare ``except:
    pass``, which meant a transient DNS hiccup or a DNS-rebinding probe would
    silently disable the SSRF defense and let the DB adapter connect anyway.
    We now return an error dict for ``socket.gaierror`` (DNS failure) and for
    any other unexpected exception, so an unresolvable or transient host can
    never slip through validation.
