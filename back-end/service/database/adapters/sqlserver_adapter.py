SQL Server Database Adapter

Implements database operations for SQL Server using pymssql.
Supports local SQL Server instances and cloud providers (Azure SQL, AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Somee.com).

Pooling note (FIX [L9])
-----------------------
pymssql has no first-class pool object, so this adapter's "pool" is the
config dict itself: each ``get_connection_from_pool`` call opens a fresh
TCP connection. ``return_connection_to_pool`` closes the connection.
Previously ``close_pool`` was a no-op, so a disconnect left every
in-flight connection open until GC. We now track open connections in a
set on the pool dict and ``close_pool`` closes them all before returning.

Query timeout (FIX [EC3])
-------------------------
SQL Server does not have a single ``SET QUERY_TIMEOUT`` statement. We
enforce a server-side lock-wait timeout via ``SET LOCK_TIMEOUT <ms>``
(see ``get_set_timeout_sql``), executed before each user query. The
asyncio ``wait_for`` cancel in the caller is the second line of defense
for CPU-bound queries that pass the lock-wait phase. Without the
``SET LOCK_TIMEOUT`` call, cancelling the Python coroutine left the
underlying DB thread alive and held the pool connection until SQL Server
itself finished — see ``operations.execute_sql_query`` and
``ai_tool_executor._execute_query_with_db_config`` for the call sites.

        FIX [EC3]: previously this returned ``None`` (the comment claimed
        "SQL Server handles timeout at connection level, not per query"),
        which meant the only timeout enforcement was
        ``asyncio.wait_for(timeout=30)`` in the calling layer. That
        cancels the Python coroutine but does NOT kill the running DB
        thread — the orphaned thread keeps the pool connection until
        SQL Server itself finishes the query (potentially minutes for a
        cross-join DoS), exhausting the pool for every other user.

        SQL Server has two relevant knobs:

        * ``SET LOCK_TIMEOUT <ms>`` — the milliseconds a statement will
          wait for a lock before raising error 1222. This is the most
          reliable server-side timeout and is what we set here.

        * ``SET QUERY_GOVERNOR_COST_LIMIT <units>`` — aborts a query
          whose estimated cost exceeds the limit (units are roughly
          10/s). It is *estimated* (not measured), so an under-estimate
          lets a slow query through. We deliberately do NOT use it here
          to avoid double-tuning; the lock timeout + the asyncio cancel
          wall is enough for the realistic DoS scenarios.

        Note: ``SET LOCK_TIMEOUT`` only covers lock-wait time, not
        execution time once the locks are acquired. A genuinely long
        CPU-bound query will still run to completion at the server. The
        ``asyncio.wait_for`` cancel in the caller is the second line of
        defense — together they cover both the lock-wait and the
        "Python gave up" cases. The caller executes the returned string
        verbatim with ``cursor.execute`` before issuing the user query.
